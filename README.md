Running checklist -

1. Do Aria
2. Alphabetically categorize CSS within a selector
3. Wrap Aria labels
4. Format Javascript well.

# Decompression Report: 

#### Progress:

We made it halfway through phase 4. We attempted to do URL validation but hit a bug and needed to work on other projects and read ahead before attempting the Clear All Read Buttons portion of phase 4. 

#### Goals Revisited:

1. We attempted ARIA using semantic tags, label for and tab indexes. 
2. We idiomatically ordered CSS from top to bottom in the left column, then in the right column, then media queries at bottom. 
3. We wrapped our aria labels around their elements. 
4. We formatted our Javascript well. We used jQuery for DOM manipulation, and Vanilla for everything else. We have one function greater than 8 lines. We used 9 global variables. This is good for us, but we will refactor more in the future.
5. We are awesome. made for git. lol
