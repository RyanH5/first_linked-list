# DTR: Define the Relationship
#### Guiding Questions to Define The Relationship:

#### What are your learning goals for this project? What drives us in this project?
Getting faster and more complete with HTML and CSS.
Navigatable with ARIA
Gaining a deeper learning for Javascript
Getting an understanding for jQuery. 

#### What is your collaboration style? How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches?
It is too early for a divide-and-conquer approach. 
We will do pair programming, using a combination of driver-navigator, remote and ping pong. 

#### How do you communicate best? How do you appreciate receiving communication from others?
Direct communication via Slack.
Remote screen sharing, if needed. 

##### How would you describe your work style?
We are both extoroverts who like trial and error.
We are going to plan functionality ahead of time and be consistent with naming style and then idiomatic CSS styling.

#### What are your strengths? How can our strengths complement each other?
We both have a good work ethic.

#### Whatâ€™s gone well or poorly in your previous projects?
This is our first project.

#### How will we set direction and make decisions as a team?
Re: collaboration style. Since we are doing mostly pair programming, we will set directions and make decisions about the code in person. We will set up when to meet via Slack and or Text. 

#### How will we overcome obstacles?
Communication. Empathy. Setting up joint work times and deadlines.

##### What do you need (resources, environment, communication) to do your best work?
Nothing special. We want to work at Turing on big TVs with other coders and not be interrupted.   

#### What scheduling restraints do you have? What are your scheduling preferences?
We both have girlfriends so nights we will try to get everything done during the morning/afternoon.
If we need to grind something out at night, we will, and that will be on a case-by-case basis. 

#### What is your style for giving feedback? Does anything ever hold you back from giving feedback?
Direct communication and setting guidelines to avoid potential problems in the future. 

#### What do you identify as being your biggest strength(s) technically, as they relate to this project? Where do you feel you could use improvement in your technical skills, as they relate to this project? How can our team help support you in improving these skills?
Ryan strength: CSS
Ryan weakness: Javascript, Git.

Matt strength: Javascript
Matt weakness: Git, CSS. 

We can both work on our Git skills during this. Ryan can help Matt with CSS. Matt can help Ryan with Javascript/jQuery. If we need extra help, we will reach out to the other students, other mods, mentors, and teachers if needed.

#### What tools do you want to use to manage the project?
Trello, Slack, iMessages. 

#### How do you want the group to solve problems when members run into issues with features of the project?
Docs, mostly. Communication. Empathy. Understanding where the other person is coming from.

#### How do you know if a project is successful? How can we achieve that as a group?
If we both achieve our learning goals.
If we make it to phase 3/4.

#### How will we recognize each other's successes and celebrate them?
